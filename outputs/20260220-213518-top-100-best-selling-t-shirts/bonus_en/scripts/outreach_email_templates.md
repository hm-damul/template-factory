## Template A — Value-first (cold)
Subject: A practical system to sell 'Top 100 best selling t shirts on Etsy 2026' with crypto checkout

Hi {Name},

I built a premium, ops-ready guide for Top 100 best selling t shirts on Etsy 2026. It includes diagrams, checklists, and a realistic case study.

If you're selling digital products globally, crypto checkout can remove chargebacks and reduce payment friction—when implemented with strong gating and support boundaries.

If helpful, I can share a 1-page summary and the diagram. Interested?
