# Short-form Promo Scripts (30–45s)

## Script 1 — Before/After
Hook: "Most crypto digital products feel like summaries. Here's what a premium one looks like."
- Before: vague PDF, no system, no metrics
- After: diagrams + checklists + case study with numbers
CTA: "Link in bio — get the premium package."

## Script 2 — Funnel Metric
Hook: "Your real problem isn't traffic; it's conversion."
Metric: LP→Checkout is often 2.2%. If yours is lower, fix hero + proof + CTA.
CTA: "I packaged the full system with diagrams and workflows."

## Script 3 — Gating
Hook: "Chargeback-free payments are great—until you accidentally give the download for free."
Point: server-side paid confirmation + gated delivery
CTA: "Get the ops-ready implementation guide."
