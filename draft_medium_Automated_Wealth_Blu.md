### 2. Automation is Key
Manual processes are the enemy of scale. By automating repetitive tasks, you free up creative energy for what really matters—innovation and connection.

### 1. Understand the Fundamentals First
Before diving into complex tactics, ensure your foundation is solid. The most successful implementations of this concept start with a clear clear strategy and defined goals.

You could try to build this system yourself, stitching together various disparate tools. Or, you could use a unified solution designed specifically for this purpose.
