THREAD 1/3 — social-media-link-in-bio
1) If you're selling digital products for crypto, the bottleneck isn't traffic — it's trust + delivery.
2) Buyers fear: 'Will I actually get the file?' Your funnel must prove delivery + support.
3) Replace vague claims with metrics: target 1.2–2.8% conversion; 90%+ payment completion.
4) Use a state machine: initiated → pending → paid → delivered → expired/refunded.
5) Gate downloads with signed tokens (1-time or time-limited). Links should not be shareable.
6) Add proof blocks: what’s inside, counts, diagrams, checklists, support macros.
7) Reduce support tickets with canned macros + troubleshooting matrix.
8) Run a 7-day launch: Day 1 setup, Day 2 content, Day 3 proof, Day 4 promo, Day 5 optimize.
9) Iterate weekly: A/B your hero + FAQ; watch checkout drop-off; fix the top 3 failures.
10) Want the full system + templates? Grab the premium bundle.
