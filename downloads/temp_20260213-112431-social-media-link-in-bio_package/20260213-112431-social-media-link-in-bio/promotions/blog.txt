Crypto buyers are not allergic to spending — they are allergic to uncertainty.
If your checkout feels like a gamble, you lose conversions even with great traffic.

## The real bottleneck: trust + delivery
Wallet buyers ask one question: *Will I actually receive the file, instantly, without drama?*
A premium digital product funnel must prove three things:
- Delivery is deterministic (paid → delivered)
- Links are not shareable (token-gated)
- Support boundaries are clear (no endless back-and-forth)

## The minimal system (that works)
Use a state machine:
1. initiated → 2. pending → 3. paid → 4. delivered → 5. expired/refunded

Then enforce fulfillment server-side:
- Issue a signed, short-lived token after payment
- Re-check paid status on download
- Optionally mark tokens as one-time-use to prevent link sharing

## What you can copy/paste from the premium bundle
- Sales page copy (problem → mechanism → proof → CTA)
- Short-form scripts for TikTok/Reels/Shorts
- Instagram caption templates with hooks and proof blocks
- Checklists + troubleshooting matrix to reduce support tickets

## A realistic case study (numbers)
Example benchmark targets:
- Landing → Checkout: 1.2–2.8% (depends on niche)
- Checkout → Paid: 35–70% (trust blocks matter)
- Paid → Download: 90%+ (fulfillment must be reliable)
